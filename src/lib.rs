//! Device-side USB stack for microcontrollers.
//!
//! This crate contains is used for implementing device-agnostic USB device classes, as well as
//! device-specific USB peripheral drivers.
//!
//! # Users
//!
//! This crate is useful for three distinct groups:
//!
//! ## End-users
//!
//! End-users will often be able to use pre-existing peripheral driver crates and USB class
//! implementation crates. The main object for end-users is [`device::UsbDevice`]. That, and related
//! types are available with `use usb_device::prelude::*`.
//!
//! ## Class implementors
//!
//! Class implementors can implement support new USB classes by using [`class::UsbClass`]. All
//! class-related types can be easily imported with `use usb_device::class_prelude::*`.
//!
//! End-users can also implement new classes if their device uses a proprietary USB based protocol.
//!
//! ## Peripheral driver implementors
//!
//! New peripheral driver crates can be created by implementing the [`bus::UsbBus`] trait.
//!
//! # Note about terminology
//!
//! This crate uses standard host-centric USB terminology for transfer directions. Therefore an OUT
//! transfer refers to host-to-device transfer, and an IN transfer refers to device-to-host
//! transfer. This is mainly a concern for implementing new USB peripheral drivers and USB classes,
//! and people doing that should be familiar with the USB standard.
